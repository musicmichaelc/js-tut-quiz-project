# &ldquo;Ninja&rdquo; Quiz project _(as part of the **Net Ninja** JS-course)_

Building a little interactive quiz app as a part of this excellent [javascript course](https://netninja.dev/p/modern-javascript-from-novice-to-ninja) by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg) alias [iamshaunjp](https://github.com/iamshaunjp).  

I can highly recommend his courses since&mdash;as I have seen so far&mdash;his teaching style is very clear and he progresses systematically from the basics to more and more advanced topics in an easygoing and friendly manner.
